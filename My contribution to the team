# Team position


Name : Kao Xiong

Role : Documentation

I had the role of documentor in my team
here is the documentation I worked on:
[Documentation](https://github.com/taimaishuze/N-Arctica-Web-Server/wiki/Documentation)

## What I contributed

As the team's documentor I had to understand everything everyone was doing
and translate it to understandable bite for the other team member or other
group.

The biggest thing I had to focus on Apache, because Apache was already a running
software on the server no one had the oppertunity to work on it. Therefore 
I had to first figure out that Apache was the platform because no one was certain.
I then had to figure out the version of apache we were using, the os we were running apache on, 
and finally the hardest one for me, how apache work. I had to go through the offical [Apache documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/)
and, with the help of Matthew, figure outhow exactly Apache communicated out website
to the world.
